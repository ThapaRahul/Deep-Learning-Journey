# Deep-Learning-Journey

This Repo is meant for enthusaist in deep learning who wants to explore the field thorugh literature reading. This repo is not meant to be a guide for showing the practical application of Deep Learning practices. However, through the literature included in this repo in a progressive manner (weekly), the viewers will be able to gain a deep understanding in the field and possibly run their own deep learning projects with a strong foundation. 


### Week 1

# Deep-Learning-Journey

This Repo is meant for enthusaists in deep learning who want to explore the field via scientific papers and literature. This repo is not intended to be a guide for practical application of Deep Learning practices. However, through the literature and discussions included in this repo (posted in a progressive manner every week), anyone interested in deep learning shall be able to gain a better understanding of concepts and theory which will definitely lead towards successful implementations of deep learning systems.

Every week the contributors of this repo shall be posting two papers from the field with their summary, confusions and discussion questions. We recommend going through those reviews after you have read the paper once and try to write your own reviews. 

Also, if you are new to reading technical/academic papers, please follow the link below.

### Week 1

In this week, we will look into an original paper on back propagation and also a survey paper on Deep Learning. We assume that at this point, you do not have a very deep understanding of these topics. Therefore, these two papers should get you started in tackling other complex topics to come. Depending on how much backgorund you have, you can skim through the materials in this week. If you are very new to the topic, please follow the links below to get an intuitive understanding of the concepts first before diving into paper which is full of technical terms and mathematical equations without full descriptions. 

We have also included the papers itself and our reviews in the week1 folder above to get a better understanding on how to tackle such papers. 

#### Paper 1: Learning representations by back-propagating errors
A walk down of the original paper:

Two very good videos on what back propagation actually is. Understanding intuitively:

# Deep-Learning-Journey

This Repo is meant for enthusaists in deep learning who want to explore the field via scientific papers and literature. This repo is not intended to be a guide for practical application of Deep Learning practices. However, through the literature and discussions included in this repo (posted in a progressive manner every week), anyone interested in deep learning shall be able to gain a better understanding of concepts and theory which will definitely lead towards successful implementations of deep learning systems.

Every week the contributors of this repo shall be posting two papers from the field with their summary, confusions and discussion questions. 


### Week 1

#### Paper 1: Learning representations by back-propagating errors
A walk down of the original paper:

Two very good videos on what back propagation actually is. Understanding intuitively:
